# To Do

- Move issues in this file to a proper issue tracking system.
- Proper usage documentation.
- Make my private libraries that are required for this script available
  somehwere online (i.e., the lockfile library). 
- Rather than definining the shows in .ezrssshows as Ruby code to be interpreted
  using eval(), define a proper persistent data structure and provide an example
  file.
- If there is a PROPER release, it should be downloaded even if the same
  episode has already been downloaded. For this, the downloaded episodes
  should somehow be marked, because even a proper release should only be
  downloaded once.
